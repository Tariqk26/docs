### Setting permissions

Once you have created an application, use the **Authorisation URL** to allow clients to install your Bookeo application to their Bookeo account. The Cyclr Bookeo connector requires the following permissions to function: `customers_r_all`,`bookings_r_all`,`payments_r_all`. Multiple permissions should be entered as a comma separated list. An authorisation URL for a Bookeo application for Cyclr has the following format: `signin.bookeo.com/?authappid=XYZ&permissions=customers_r_all,bookings_r_all,payments_r_all`.
